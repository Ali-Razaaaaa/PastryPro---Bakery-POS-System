🍰 PastryPro – Bakery POS System

PastryPro is a sleek, single-user Point of Sale (POS) system tailored for small bakeries.
It allows bakery owners to efficiently manage products, orders, customers, and staff — all from one intuitive dashboard.

Built with React on the frontend, Node.js + Express on the backend, and MySQL as the database,
PastryPro provides real-time insights into sales, top products, and low-stock alerts to keep operations running smoothly.

I designed PastryPro during my summer vacation in 2025 after completing my 6th semester to improve my SQL and full-stack development skills.
